- **After:** Largest chunk 479 KB, most routes <50 KB
- **Improvement:** ~67% reduction in initial load size

### 5. **Error Boundaries Active** (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
- ✅ Global error boundary in App.tsx (already present)
- ✅ Suspense fallbacks for all lazy-loaded routes
- ✅ Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### 6. **Browserslist Updated** (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
- ✅ Updated caniuse-lite database to latest version
- ✅ Targeting correct browser versions
- ✅ No more outdated browser data warnings

### 7. **Deployment Documentation Created** (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide created
- ✅ Covers all deployment scenarios
- ✅ Includes troubleshooting section
- ✅ Rollback procedures documented

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **No Test Coverage**
   - Recommend adding tests post-deployment
   - Critical paths should be tested manually before go-live

2. **TypeScript `any` Usage**
   - 200 instances remain
   - Not blocking deployment
   - Recommend gradual reduction

3. **No Error Tracking Service**
   - Recommend integrating Sentry or similar
   - Can be added post-deployment

4. **No Performance Monitoring**
   - Recommend adding analytics
   - Consider Lighthouse CI
